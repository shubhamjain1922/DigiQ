## It Create and Manage Queues in an efficient way. No need to stand in the queue anymore. Just let the technology do the work for you while you work on things that matters the most. 

Let's deep dive into it's features.

1) As a creator of the queue:

- You have full access to the working of the queue.
- Our service will generate a QR code once you create a queue. The QR code or the queue id can be shared with everyone.
- You get the details of all the queues you have created; you can deactivate a queue, activate a queue, delete a queue, and move the queue ahead.

2) As a member of the queue:

- You can join any queue available from the app or you can enter the queue ID or scan the QR code from the scanner embedded in our android app.
- The app informs you about your position in the queue as well as the expected waiting time for the queue. You may decide to leave the queue if you wish to.
